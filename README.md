# neural_analysis_tools
These are functions/ programmes for analysing various different types of data collected in a systems neuroscience lab

I make use of NEO-core objects for neurophysiological data but functions could also be used without it.
I also make use of click decorators so that functions are callable from the terminal. 
Scripts compatible with Python3.x
